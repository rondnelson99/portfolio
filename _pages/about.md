Hi, I’m Ron, a third-year student in UBC Engineering Physics. My biggest interests are in electronics and embedded computing, but I’m also fond of mountain biking and playing the trumpet. I have work experience in both embedded hardware engineering and IT. and consider myself a hard worker and excellent team member. I made this site to show off a few of my most interesting projects, both personal and school related.
