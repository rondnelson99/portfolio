For this project, I worked in a team of five to create two autonomous devices with the goals of quickly gathering a wide variety of objects, and precisely stacking foam blocks. We met these challenges with two separate designs. One was narrow, with a limited range of motion but a high degree of precision. The other used an unconventional design where the objects would stick to outward-facing tape on the device's exterior, where they'd then be pushed off by a slotted arm.

Both designs were based around an Arduino microcontroller and operated autonomously using an ultrasonic rangefinder and actuated using a servo motor. I wrote all our team's code for the project. The designs were created from sheet metal using hand tools such as snips, pliers, riveters, and nibblers.

To support accurate, parameterized design, I also modelled our designs in SOLIDWORKS using the Sheet Metal tool. The final models contain several discrete components appropriately mated together to visualize operation.
