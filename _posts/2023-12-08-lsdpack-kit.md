In my time as an active member of the Game Boy reverse engineering / homebrew development community, I saw the wide variety of works created with the system. I saw that lots of amateur musicians would spend countless hours creating music using [Little Sound DJ](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php), a music composition / sequencing software. However, this tool left musicians no way to release their masterpieces without advanced Assembly programming knowledge.

To remedy this, I collaborated with musician S_TN to create [HELLO WORLD](https://s-tn.itch.io/hello-world), a music cartridge created with my original tool lsdpack-kit. This is a tool that takes an album created using LSDJ, and combines it with custom graphics to create a polished, beautiful cartridge file, suitable for burning to a real cartridge or digital distribution. It requires no programming ability, and has since been used by other musicians to create more albums.
