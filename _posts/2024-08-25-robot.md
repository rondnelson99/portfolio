This project was created for Engineering Physics' Robot Summer program where we spend two months working in teams to build autonomous robots from scratch, which compete in a competition in August. The aim is to develop experience and intuition with electrical, mechanical and embedded software challenges, as well as teamwork and project management. This year, the project's theme was the game *Overcooked!*, so each team developed two autonomous robots which had to cooperatively assemble burgers made from 3D-printed parts.

Our robots performed quite well. Very few teams could score points at all on competition day, but we were able to cook "fries" as well as assemble and cook burgers. Overall, we placed third out of ~16 teams in the competition.

*A test run of our robots' competition routines*

We made two robots for this project, although I was mainly the lead for the "serving" robot which is the focus of the above video. The serving robot has 5 motors: two powered wheels for skid-steer driving, and three degrees of freedom for the other parts of the robot. There is a large rake-like structure which can rotate and extend in order to sweep food and plates off the counter, and a bed which swings on parallel links so that the food can be raised and lowered. The same rake also provides serving functionality.

# Mechanical

Mechanical design was very "from scratch" in this project, like the other parts in the design. There was no mechanical kits or templates. I believe that the trick to get the mechanical portions working better sooner was to get as much CAD done as possible earlier in the process, so that we can more rapidly prototype using the laser cutter, 3D printers and Waterjet.

The models can be complex and time-consuming to create, but keeping everything together is worthwhile because if the model is consistent and accurate, SOLIDOWORKS will ensure that everything is sized properly and fits together. 

A recurring challenge with mechancial design is ensuring that everything is sturdy and rigid enough to deliver the nescessary precision. We added supporting structures where needed, but I believe a strong point of this robot is its oversized, funneling design on the rake. The high amount of slop it allows is needed to accoun for uncertainty in the position of items.

Another mechancial aspect of the robot which I'm proud of is the ease of (dis)assembly. The frequent use of presswood in the design allows the creation of relatively strong press fits using tabs and slots once I took some time to cut some test pieces and fine-tune the tolerances. In the end, there are relatively few screws whcih saved a ton of time.

# Electrical

The electrical part was also very "from scratch," with several hand-made circuits soldered to perfboards. The robot used two electically isolated power supples: one 16V Li-Po battery for motors, and a second 9V battery for sensors and our microcontroller. Some examples of the circuits used are found below:
- Off-the-shelf motor controller ICs were banned for the competition, so we built our own using NPN transistors and gate drivers.

- We used mechanical rotary encoders for most axes of motion, which needed debouncing through RC filters and Schmitt Triggers in order to implement reliable interrupt-driven software support.

- A relatively dense perfboard was used to connect each component to our ESP32-S3 microcontroller.

All these circuits were connected with jumper wire and JST XH series crimped conntectors.

# Software
I built the majority of our teams software. We designed the robots' code to be modular and quick to iterate on, which was essential given the course's intense timeline. We used an ESP32-S3 with PlatformIO. I highlight a few features below:
- **Modular design**: Each motor/sensor was its own file which contained its own state machine as well as an interface to change states and readdata. This also applied to software colntrols. For instance, we used a PID motor class which encapsulated both an instance of `PIDController` and `Motor` (which abstracted away the PID system itself and generating the PWM signals to run our H-Bridges) and provided methods to run to positions, actively brake at a target position, etc. Interrupts were also used to keep functions like motor controllers entirely indpeendent
- **Task Queue**: Many teams used explicit state machines to control their robot's overall sequence through the competition, but since each team had a set sequence of tasks to perform (which can become quite convoluted), we felt that it would help us iterate to include a system which queues up task commands with associated timeouts and/or end conditions. I architeched such a system so that everything is still non-blocking, but complex sequences can be developed extremely quickly.
- **Web Server**: When testing their robots, teams can need large amounts of iteration and debugging for their code. Often, this means dealign with dangling USB cables, tiny OLED displays on the robot, or similarly finnicky solutions. I developed a web server system using the ESP32-S3's Wi-Fi capabilities, which provides simple numerical input, output and control functions. Most importantly, any part of the code can easily call a function from the server to add a new function without any modification to the server module. We also used OTA updates to avoid dealing with cables during upload.
