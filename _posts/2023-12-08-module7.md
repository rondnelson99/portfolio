For this project, I designed and simulated a complex rainwater harvesting system with a team of five. The system was designed to serve as the primary water supply for a two-person household in a semi-remote BC community. The final system includes roof-based water catchment, a large storage tank which is elevated to maximize output pressure, a combination of chlorine and UV disinfection, and 3-stage filtration. We also designed a power system leveraging solar power, batteries, and an inverter to run the pump.

For each of these parameters, we considered multiple alternatives such as ozone disinfection, a diesel generator for power, off-roof water catchment and more. We assessed these alternatives using a large Excel simulation considering:

· Power throughput and storage

· Wear and maintenance on filters, chlorine, and other components

· Available water volume with dynamic, seasonal weather conditions

· Construction and operation costs of each component

· Water energy and flowrate analysis using height, distance, and losses from piping and components.
