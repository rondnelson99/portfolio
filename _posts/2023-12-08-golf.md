For this personal project, I learned to develop games for the Nintendo Game Boy. To optimize use of its slow 8-bit processor, all my code is written in pure assembly.

The game is about Golf, inspired by Golf for the NES. It s possible to take shots in 16 directions, and curve them for greater precision. There are multiple surfaces with different levels of friction, such as bunkers. On the green, you can enter a zoomed-in view and make very precise plays, but now there are tricky slopes to contend with.

Using Assembly comes with a lot of challenges and required thinking about computing at a very low level. For instance, operations as simple as multiplication can require complex, optimized code to effectively minimize cycle and register use.

```
SignedHTimesC::

xor a ;clear our workspace
ld l, a
ld b, a

; special first iteration
add hl, hl ;this shifts the sign of the signed multiplier into carry
jr nc, :+
; for the multiplication part, we can load instead of add for this first round
ld l, c
; but if we're hare then l is negative, so we need get negative c into a to add it later
sub c ;a was zero before
; now a is negative c if h was negative, or zero if x was positive
:

REPT 7 ; the other 7 iterations are standard binary long multiplication
add hl, hl
jr nc, :+
add hl, bc
:
ENDR

; now we finish off by adding a to h to correct for the sign
add a, h
ld h, a

ret
```

 

As part of this project, I designed and built a cartridge circuit board using Autodesk EAGLE. It's a novel design that is extremely simple, while still allowing for advanced features through software.
